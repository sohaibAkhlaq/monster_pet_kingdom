# Monster Pet Kingdom

## Overview
Monster Pet Kingdom is a real-time battle game developed as part of the
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The project is implemented in
C++ and uses the SFML graphics library to provide an interactive and
graphical gaming experience.

The game focuses on applying complete object-oriented design principles
while building a feature-rich monster battle system with progression,
training, and competitive modes.

## Game Modes
- Real-time 1 vs 1 Monster Battle
- Real-time 2 vs 2 Team Battle
- Guild War Mode
- Training Mode for monster progression
- Leaderboard system for competitive ranking

## Key Features
- Real-time simultaneous gameplay using keyboard controls
- Graphical interface rendered using SFML
- Training mode to earn points and improve monster stats
- In-game shop system to purchase upgrades using earned points
- Multiple monsters with different attributes and abilities
- Persistent leaderboard and player data using file handling

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Players control monsters simultaneously using assigned keys
- Battles are not turn-based and rely on real-time movement and actions
- Training mode allows players to increase power points and attributes
- Shop system enables strategic upgrades and customization

## OOP Concepts Implemented
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation of game entities
- Inheritance for monster and player hierarchies
- Polymorphism for battle behaviors and abilities
- Abstraction through modular game components
- File handling for saving progress and leaderboard data
- Clean separation of logic, rendering, and data handling

## Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Graphics Library: SFML
- Platform: Desktop Application

## Project Structure
- src/  
  Contains all game logic, classes, and core implementations
- assets/  
  Game textures, sprites, fonts, and visual resources
- data/  
  Stores player data, leaderboard records, and configuration files

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sohaibAkhlaq/monster-pet-kingdom.git
2. Ensure SFML is installed and configured on your system.
3. Compile the project with SFML linked properly.
4. Run the generated executable to start the game.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of complete OOP concepts in a large project
- Experience developing real-time systems using SFML
- Improved understanding of game loops and event handling
- Stronger code organization and modular design skills

## Future Improvements
- AI-controlled opponents
- Additional monsters and abilities
- Enhanced animations and visual effects
- Online multiplayer support
